AdVantage POC: AI-Powered Ad Copy Analysis & GenerationThis proof-of-concept (POC) application analyzes Google Ads performance data to identify underperforming ads and uses the Google Gemini AI to generate new, optimized ad copy suggestions.FeaturesData-Driven Analysis: Identifies underperforming ads based on impressions and Click-Through Rate (CTR).N-Gram Analysis:Finds "Gold Nugget" n-grams: High-converting phrases to use in ad descriptions.Finds "Mismatched" n-grams: High-impression, low-CTR phrases to incorporate into headlines for better relevance.AI-Powered Suggestions: Leverages the Gemini AI to craft new ad headlines and descriptions based on the analysis.Web-Based UI: An easy-to-use interface built with NiceGUI for uploading data and viewing results.How to Run the ApplicationFollow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.1. PrerequisitesPython 3.7+pip for package installation2. Setupa. Clone the RepositoryIf you have this project in a git repository, clone it. Otherwise, make sure all the project files are in a single directory on your computer.git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>
b. Create a Virtual EnvironmentIt's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
c. Install DependenciesInstall all the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file.pip install -r requirements.txt
d. Set Up Your Environment VariablesThe application requires an API key for the Google Gemini AI.Create a new file named .env in the root directory of the project.Open the .env file and add your API key in the following format:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual Gemini API key.3. Running the AppOnce the setup is complete, you can run the application with a single command:python app_ui.py
After running the command, you will see output in your terminal indicating that the server is running. It will provide a local URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080).Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.4. Using the InterfaceUpload Data: Use the upload buttons to provide your ads.csv and search_terms.csv files.Run Analysis: Click the "Run Analysis & Generate Suggestions" button.View Results:The "Analysis Results" tab will show you which ads are underperforming and the key n-grams identified from your data.The "AI-Powered Ad Copy Suggestions" tab will display the new ad variations generated by the AI.Project File Structure.
